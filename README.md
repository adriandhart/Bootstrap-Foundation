Bootstrap With Foundation's Grid System
================================

##Introduction

**Coming Soon: Twitter's Bootstrap v2.3.1, but with the grid from Foundation 4!**

For those of you who love the flexibility of the grid from Foundation 4's framework, but prefer the UI elements of Bootstrap, I am combining the two. This framework will be Twitter's Bootstrap, but with the grid system from Zurb's Foundation 4.

I will also be making sure that the Foundation grid works in earlier versions of Internet Explorer, which it does not do out-of-the-box. After all, I think it is still too soon to abandon IE7 & 8, although I would love to!

##Tasks

The tasks to be completed in this project:

- Add [Bootstrap 2.3.1](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap "Twitter Boostrap 2.3.1") to repo (master, not compiled version) - ***Done!***
- Comment out (but not delete) include for grid.less from bootstrap.less
- Add new less file containing styles for grid from [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/ "Zurb Foundation 4 Framework")
- Get the grid working in IE7 & IE8, either responsive, or fall back to static grid
